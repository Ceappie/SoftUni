There are several types of database relationships.

    One to One Relationships
    One to Many and Many to One Relationships
    Many to Many Relationships

One to One Relationships

One cusomer has one name.


One to Many and Many to One Relationships

This is the most commonly used type of relationship. Consider an e-commerce website, with the following:

    Customers can make many orders.
    Orders can contain many items.
    Items can have descriptions in many languages.

In these cases we would need to create "One to Many" relationships.


Many to Many Relationships

In some cases, you may need multiple instances on both sides of the relationship. For example, each order can contain multiple items. And each item can also be in multiple orders.
